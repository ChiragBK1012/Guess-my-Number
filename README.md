# 🎯 Guess My Number

A simple and interactive number guessing game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Guess the number between **1 and 20** before your score runs out.  
Track your **high score** during the session and try to beat it!

## 🔍 How to Play

- The computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 20**.
- You try to guess the correct number.
- For each wrong guess:
  - A hint is shown (Too High / Too Low).
  - Your score decreases by 1.
- If you guess correctly:
  - You win and your score is compared with the current high score.
  - High score is updated if your score is higher.
- If your score reaches **0**, you **lose**.
- The **high score is session-based** (it resets when the page is refreshed).
